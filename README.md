# DS542 ChainThought â€“ AI Chatbot

This repository contains the AI chatbot built by **Derek, Eric, and Brandon** for the DS542 ChainThought project.

**Note:** The chatbot currently relies on locally hosted language models (LLMs) via LM Studio. As such, the application will only function correctly when run on a local machine following the setup guide in the https://github.com/ericgulottyjr/ChainThought/tree/recreate_setup read.me.
